# ROMS Initial and Boundary Condition Generator

This code is for generating **initial and boundary conditions** for the ROMS model.  
It is currently under development and based on HYCOM data aligned with `Domain.nc`.

## Development Status

- `mk_bry.py`: Time-related processing is still under consideration.
- Western boundary logic in `mk_bry.py` has not been validated yet.
- Currently tailored for a **rotated grid**; support for **general grids** will be added soon.
